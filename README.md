# Getting Started with npx Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `App can be simply cloned`

git clone https://github.com/iakai00/stakingpool-metrotoken.git

### `npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies required for the applications.

### `truffle init`

This will create a truffle.config file inside the directory if not present.
You can change the port address, paths for the build outputs and other settings from this file.

### `truffle test`

Note: Remember to keep the Ganache CLI or Ganache UI up and running.
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
And the app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `truffle compile`

This will compile the contracts that were changed and save ABIs in the form of JSON. Can add '--add' at the end to compile all the contracts.

### `truffle migrate --reset`

This will deploy all of the contracts to the blockchain.
